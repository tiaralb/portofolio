When I started learning Flutter, I didn't immediately jump into mobile app development. Instead, I began with web development using Flutter. It may sound unusual to use Flutter for web development, but now Flutter web has become quite stable, and my company decided to adopt Flutter as the technology of choice. Starting this journey was not easy, but I began by understanding the project structure in Flutter and familiarizing myself with widgets to create UI for applications.

After that, I proceeded with data integration using Dio, and I started getting assigned tasks such as adding new features and pages to the internal dashboard. This involved utilizing the knowledge I gained in Flutter to enhance the functionality and user experience of the dashboard.

Despite the initial challenges, I embraced the opportunity to expand my skills and contribute to the development of web applications using Flutter. It was a valuable experience that allowed me to leverage the flexibility and efficiency of Flutter for both mobile and web development.
