This website showcases a project that I developed during a major assignment in my university. I aimed to digitize the bookkeeping process for a cooperative. The web application I created utilizes the PHP framework CodeIgniter and MySQL as the database for data storage.

The website features a login page that provides access for cooperative staff members. It also includes a registration menu for staff members to create their accounts. Additionally, the website incorporates a flow for members to request loans and records all transactions performed by members. The system allows for the generation and printing of comprehensive reports.

The primary objective of this project was to streamline the cooperative's bookkeeping process by transitioning from manual methods to an efficient and digital solution. By developing this website, I sought to enhance data accuracy, simplify record-keeping, and improve overall operational efficiency for the cooperative.
