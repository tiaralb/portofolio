Before working on the Mobile Apps project, I worked on the Internal Dashboard for manual EKYC checking and approval using ReactJS. However, I was transferred to another squad, so the internal dashboard project was handed over to another team. In this new squad, I took on the mobile project called Pinang Prakasa, using Dart Flutter and the stacked (MVVM) architecture. Here is a description of my work while working at Bank Raya Indonesia:

- Developed internal web admin using React.js: I was responsible for developing the internal web admin using React.js. This involved creating user interfaces, implementing functionalities, and ensuring smooth operation of the dashboard.

- Collaborated with project managers, UI/UX, and other developers within and across teams: I actively collaborated with project managers, UI/UX designers, and other developers both within my team and across different teams. This involved discussing project requirements, coordinating tasks, and ensuring seamless teamwork.

- Understanding of the Agile development life-cycle: I had a solid understanding of the Agile development life-cycle. I followed Agile methodologies and participated in sprint planning, daily stand-ups, and retrospective meetings to ensure efficient project delivery.

- Write readable code, create extensive documentation for existing code, and refactor previously written code into a readable state using Flutter: I focused on writing clean and readable code, ensuring that it was well-documented for easy understanding and maintenance. Additionally, I worked on refactoring existing code written in Flutter to improve its readability and maintainability.

- Maintenance of applications and addition of features as per the product team's requests: I was responsible for maintaining the applications and adding new features based on the requests from the product team. This involved troubleshooting issues, fixing bugs, and implementing enhancements to meet the evolving needs of the project.
